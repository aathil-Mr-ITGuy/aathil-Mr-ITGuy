Fun Tech Childhood
Here's a fun fact about my tech-savvy childhood: I was the only kid in my class for a long period who knew how to format a PC, crack passwords, and stay up-to-date with the latest tech updates. I guess you could say I was the ultimate tech guru of my time! 💻

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with you all on some exciting projects!

Keep coding and stay awesome! ✨
